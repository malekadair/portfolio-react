          I feel that I've always had the mind of a developer but have never had
          the opportunity to "develop" my skills enough to be dangerous until
          diving head-first into Thinkfulâ€™s bootcamp. I look forward to the
          future of working on a team alongside other great developers. What
          better atmosphere to continue growing and learning from others.
        </p>

          When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me playing pool, mountain
          biking, or cleaning up after my dog. Each challenging in its own way.
          These challenges are what drive my passion for continuous growth.
